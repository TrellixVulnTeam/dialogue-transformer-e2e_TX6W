# dialogue-transformer-e2e

This is a repository for End-to-end Dialogue Transformer project for [Statistical Dialogue Systems](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/courses/npfl099) course.

## Goals
- [ ] Improve sequicity comments
- [ ] Use PyTorch's `nn.transformer` to implement Sequicity style dialogue system
    - [x] Try to run Sequicity as is - this *should* be quite easy.
    - [ ] Rewrite classes `SimpleDynamicEncoder`, `BSpanDecoder`, and `ResponseDecoder` from `tsd_net.py` to use transformer instead of RNNs.
        This will probably involve also adjusting `TSD` class.
- [ ] Compare it with existing dialogue systems (probably Sequicity, mainly)
- [ ] Improve performance by utilizing pre-trained LM

- [ALBERT: A Lite BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11942.pdf) - IHMO (ondrej) the methods described in this paper might be easier to use with limited computational resources compared to other pretrained transformers (BERT, GPT-2, XLNet, Transformer-XL, ...)
- [Training Tips for the Transfomer Model](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pbml/110/art-popel-bojar.pdf) - A nice paper form UFAL about practical tips for training transformer, might be useful
- [On Layer Normalization in the Transformer Architecture](https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1x8anVFPr) - They stabilize the training by placing layer normalization inside the residual block and before the multi-head attention (Pre-LN). Therefore they can remove warm-up and use a larger learning rate.
